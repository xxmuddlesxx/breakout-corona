===============

a mobile Platform game to the Atari look-a-like breakout,


<b>To Do</b>

Physic tweaks:
The Ball moves at a nice speed but still has some anonymolous movements to it such as moving the opposite direction after hitting a block (due to physic calculation iterations which degrade precision the lower they are set)

Moar levels

some good thinking about here as far as stages go, a bonus stage could go pretty far.


Boss Mode

Mix BreakOut with Pong, 

thinking about giving some persistent networking coding a go too if time permits for a multiplayer mode.
